# DS&A Interview

## Feedback from last cohort

make sure to talk through your solution and don't be afraid to clarify the question. the guy who did my interview said that I got the hardest version and there were a few that I definitely didn't get solved but I got through because I talked through the solution and my general algorithms were sound even if I didn't always get the code right. also they did ask me to give the time complexity for all of the solutions I came up with so make sure you know how to determine big O.
you get an hour for this one and I got asked 5 coding/ technical questions in total but I didn't have to code for all of them. some were just to ensure I knew what the basic steps for navigating through data types were.
i definitely got some points as well for asking him to clarify some of the problems and a few were asking me to do things that the interviewer admitted wasn't possible to see if I could tell the limits of certain data structures and algorithm solutions.

and another: 

asking for clarification was the only thing i got dinged on. He even prompted me to ask for more by asking me if i was making any assumptions in my code. I think i would have failed if i hadn't known a second way to approach the coding problem at the end. I coded the whole thing out and we talked through it and it wasn't sounding good, but then he asked if i could think of another approach and i talked about using a hash table if the data wasn't sorted and i think that pushed me over the mark
its hard to tell because this interview isnt grated like the other ones. You dont get stars or a clear passing mark, just feedback
